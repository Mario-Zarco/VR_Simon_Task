# VR_Simon_Task
 

I developed cognitive tasks in virtual reality during my role as a Research Assistant in the Cognitive, Manual, and Neural Dynamics (CMND) Lab led by Dr Christopher Erb.
The tasks were designed to collect hand and gaze tracking data.
This repository contains an initial version of the Simon task in Virtual Reality
If you are interested in knowing more about these projects, please contact the CMND Lab.

The video shows an example of the collected data.
